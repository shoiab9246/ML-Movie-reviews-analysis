# Sentiment-Analysis


### Problem/ Project Description:

The dataset used in this project is known as the "Polarity Dataset". This dataset consists of 1000 positive movie reviews and 1000 negative movie reviews. The goal of this project is to train a model such that given a movie review, the trained model should be able to classify the emotion of the review as positive or negative.

**Model used:** Bag Of Words model, Multilayered Perceptron.

**Tools Used:** NLTK, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Keras or PyTorch

**Language used:** Python

**Project:** To see the project inplementation in Keras open [this](https://github.com/Meghana-Meghana/Sentiment-Analysis/blob/master/Sentiment%20Analysis%20using%20Bag%20of%20Words%20model.ipynb) notebook and for implementation in PyTorch, open [this](https://github.com/Meghana-Meghana/Sentiment-Analysis/blob/master/Sentiment%20Analysis%20using%20Bag%20of%20Words%20model_PyTorch.ipynb) notebook.

**Helper:** You may refer the short [tutorial](https://github.com/Meghana-Meghana/Sentiment-Analysis/blob/master/Short%20tutorial.ipynb) of some functions used in the project.

**Try it Yourself:** You can download and execute the python file after installing all the tools used.

**P.S:** This project is inspired by this [post](https://machinelearningmastery.com/deep-learning-bag-of-words-model-sentiment-analysis/).
